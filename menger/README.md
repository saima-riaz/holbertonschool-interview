## Description
This project implements a 2D version of the Menger Sponge, a fractal with a distinctive recursive structure that divides space into a grid and removes specific portions to create intricate patterns. The Menger Sponge illustrates concepts of fractal geometry, recursion, and self-similarity, making it both a visually intriguing and mathematically rich structure.


### How It Works
- A 2D Menger Sponge is a square grid, where each level of recursion divides the grid into smaller sections. At each level:

- The square is divided into a 3x3 grid.
- The center cell in each grid is removed, leaving a hole.
- This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller squares to the desired depth, forming a fractal pattern.

### Requirements General For Project

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called menger.h
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
